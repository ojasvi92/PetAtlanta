Prototype for an online marketplace for selling dry dog food by employing requirement analysis methods, conceptual and logical data modelling, Oracle database objects, web UI design (HTML5, CSS3, JQuery) and Adobe ColdFusion server as middleware.

This website prototype has the following pages:

4. Cart page
5. Account creation (Add payment details) Page
6. Login Page
7. Check-out Page
8. Order History Page
9. User Profile Page
10. About Us Page

* It has basic functionality where a buyer can check details of a product and add it to the cart and then proceed to checkout or continue shopping. 
* Before placing an order, the buyer is required to create a user account first and add their card details.
* After creating account, the user needs to login with their credentials before checking out.
* The user gets to see the orders he has placed on the Order History page.
* If required, the users can also update their profiles from the User-profile page.

This prototype was built on a three day timeline and hence has limited functionality.
